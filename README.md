# Encoder-Decoder-Model-for-Rainfall-Runoff-Modeling (Case of Upper Awash Basin in Ethiopia)
Implementation of different LSTM models including Encoder-Decoder based approaches for Rainfall-Runoff Modeling for Awash River in Ethiopia.
Time series prediction is a widespread problem. Applications range from price and weather/flood/rain-fall runoff forecasting to biological signal prediction.

In this project I try to demonstrate implemention of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based vanilla LSTM/GRU and encoder-decoder models for time series prediction task using Keras. I have used a case study of the Upper Awash basin Meteorological and Hydrological data which is recorded at various record stations. I have used 28 years of daily recorded data.

In this repo I provide the data used and the detailed experimental setups for the different vanilla LSTM/GRU and Encoder-Decoder based approaches. You can download the zip file of this ripo and run it on Google Colab. Details of the experiments are found on the provided notebook files.
